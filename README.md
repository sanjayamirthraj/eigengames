## Introduction

This repo contains our implementation of a parallel transaction pool for EigenLayer's AVS. We're tackling Ethereum's limitation in traditional blockchain transaction processing, which currently forces transactions from the same account to be processed one after another in strict nonce order. Our parallel transaction algorithm and batching improves this by figuring out which transactions can be executed at the same time, while still making sure dependent transactions happen in the right order.

We've managed to significantly boost performance and throughput by applying smart parallelization techniques, kind of like how multi-threaded processors work in modern computers. The best part is that our implementation maintains all of the security and consistency guarantees while making much better use of available resources.

## Implementation Overview

The system uses a state access batching algorithm to figure out which transactions can be processed simultaneously and which ones need to wait. It's similar to how web servers handle multiple requests concurrently while making sure related operations still happen in the right sequence.

Our solution solves parallel execution by intelligently batching transactions from the mempool based on independent state accesses, allowing us to propose more efficient blocks. We've developed two possible implementation paths:

We have the brains of the operation with our custom algorithms, and we look to speed up ETH 

### 1. Implementing our custom algorithm through an Alternative Layer 1 (Alt-L1) Implementation -- EIGENChain

Our first approach involves creating a complete alternative Layer 1 blockchain that natively supports parallel transaction execution. This implementation:

- Uses custom consensus mechanisms optimized for parallel processing
- Incorporates parallel execution directly into the block production pipeline
- Features native support for transaction dependency analysis and grouping
- Provides built-in mempool organization for efficient batching
- Includes specialized validator logic to ensure consistency across parallel executions

The Alt-L1 approach gives us complete freedom to optimize the entire blockchain stack for parallelism, from transaction submission to block production and validation.

### 2. Custom Client Implementation 

Our second approach involves creating a custom client implementation that works within the existing ecosystem through an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP). This implementation introduces parallel execution capabilities through specialized transaction types

More on the client:


## Custom Client Implementation Details

Our custom client introduces parallel transaction processing through a well-defined EIP that extends current capabilities without breaking compatibility. The implementation includes:

### Core Components

Our implementation is spread across these main modules:

- `core/txpool/parallelpool/parallelpool.go`: Main implementation of the parallel transaction pool
- `core/txpool/parallelpool/list.go`: Handles transaction storage and organization
- `core/txpool/parallelpool/interfaces.go`: Defines interfaces for tracking nonces and looking up transactions
- `core/txpool/parallelpool/api.go`: Provides enhanced API for tagging transactions and managing batches

### Key Architectural Elements

#### 1. Transaction Tagging System

We decided to use a simple but effective tagging system to identify which transactions can run in parallel:

```go
const (
    // Tag identifiers within transaction data
    ParallelizableTag = "PARALLEL"
    SequentialTag     = "SEQUENTIAL"
)
```

Transactions get these tags prefixed to their data field, which makes them super easy to identify without having to do complex dependency analysis. This approach really simplifies parallelization while staying compatible with existing transaction processing.

#### 2. The ParallelPool Architecture

The `ParallelPool` is the heart of our implementation. It:

- Keeps track of pending transactions that are ready to go
- Maintains a queue of transactions waiting to be processed
- Groups parallelizable transactions into batches for efficient execution
- Uses smart prioritization to determine optimal execution order

This design is pretty similar to resource management systems you'd find in distributed computing, where you need to maintain global state while still allowing some operations to happen concurrently.

#### 3. Batch Processing System

We came up with a batch processing system that looks like this:

```go
type TxBatch struct {
    Transactions []*types.Transaction
    BatchID      uint64
}
```

This structure groups compatible transactions that can be processed in parallel, with configurable batch sizes (default is 64, max is 256). The batch system automatically:

- Groups transactions from different accounts that can safely run in parallel
- Assigns unique batch IDs so we can track and monitor them
- Optimizes how batches are composed to maximize throughput

#### 4. Enhanced API for Parallel Transaction Management

We've built a comprehensive API for working with parallel transactions:

```go
// ParallelTxPoolAPI offers an API for working with parallel transactions
type ParallelTxPoolAPI struct {
    pool *ParallelPool
}
```

This API lets you:
- Tag transactions as parallelizable or sequential
- Configure batch sizes to suit your needs
- Trigger batch execution when you want
- Get detailed stats about your transactions and batches
- Analyze transaction data to see if it's suitable for parallelization

### Transaction Processing Flow

#### Transaction Type Definition

We defined a new transaction type identifier (`0x05`) for parallel-capable transactions, which ensures backward compatibility with existing transaction types:

```go
const (
    // ParallelTxType is the transaction type for parallel transactions
    ParallelTxType = 0x05
    
    // Configuration constants
    txPoolGlobalSlots = 4096            // Maximum transaction capacity
    txMaxSize         = 4 * 1024 * 1024 // Maximum transaction size (4MB)
)
```

#### Transaction Tagging and Validation

When you create a transaction for parallel processing, it goes through a tagging process:

```go
// TagTransaction adds parallelization tags to a transaction
func (api *ParallelTxPoolAPI) TagTransaction(ctx context.Context, args TagTransactionRequest) (hexutil.Bytes, error) {
    // ...
    
    // Add parallel tag to data
    if args.Parallel {
        data = append([]byte(ParallelizableTag), args.Data...)
        log.Debug("Tagged transaction as parallelizable", "from", args.From, "to", args.To)
    } else {
        data = append([]byte(SequentialTag), args.Data...)
        log.Debug("Tagged transaction as sequential", "from", args.From, "to", args.To)
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

This tagging approach has several advantages:
1. It makes detecting parallelizable transactions really simple
2. It lets clients decide which transactions can be parallelized
3. It saves us from having to do complex dependency analysis at runtime

#### Batch Preparation and Execution

The system automatically organizes parallelizable transactions into batches for efficient execution:

```go
// prepareBatches organizes parallelizable transactions into execution batches
func (p *ParallelPool) prepareBatches() {
    // ...
    
    // Create new batches
    p.batchedTxs = nil
    var currentBatch TxBatch
    currentBatch.Transactions = make([]*types.Transaction, 0, p.batchSize)
    currentBatch.BatchID = uint64(time.Now().UnixNano())

    // Collect transactions from all accounts
    txCount := 0
    for addr, txs := range p.parallelizableTxs {
        for _, tx := range txs {
            currentBatch.Transactions = append(currentBatch.Transactions, tx)
            txCount++

            // When batch is full, add it and create a new one
            if txCount >= p.batchSize {
                p.batchedTxs = append(p.batchedTxs, currentBatch)
                currentBatch.Transactions = make([]*types.Transaction, 0, p.batchSize)
                currentBatch.BatchID = uint64(time.Now().UnixNano())
                txCount = 0
            }
        }
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

The batch execution process takes advantage of multi-core processors for true parallelism:

```go
// ExecuteBatch executes a batch of parallelizable transactions
func (p *ParallelPool) ExecuteBatch(batch TxBatch) ([]common.Hash, error) {
    // ...
    
    // Use semaphore to limit concurrent executions if needed
    sem := make(chan struct{}, runtime.NumCPU())
    
    // Clone state for each transaction to isolate changes
    for _, tx := range batch.Transactions {
        // ...
        
        go func() {
            // Create an isolated state copy for this transaction
            txStateDB := stateDB.Copy()
            
            // Process transaction (would integrate with EVM in real implementation)
            // ...
        }()
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

## Integration with EigenLayer AVS

Our implementation integrates with EigenLayer's AVS by:

1. Extending the AVS to support parallel transaction processing
2. Introducing specialized handling for state-independent transaction batches
3. Optimizing the block proposal process to include parallel-executed transactions 
4. Enhancing validator logic to verify parallel execution results

The integration allows EigenLayer AVS to benefit from parallel execution while maintaining its core security properties and restaking mechanisms. By batching transactions based on independent state accesses, our solution significantly increases the throughput capabilities of EigenLayer-based systems.

## Performance Improvements

Our parallel transaction pool delivers some significant performance improvements:

1. **Higher Throughput**: Parallel execution of independent transactions really boosts processing capacity, similar to how multi-threading speeds up CPU performance
2. **Lower Latency**: Critical transactions don't have to wait for unrelated ones, so they get confirmed faster
3. **Better Resource Usage**: Modern multi-core systems can efficiently distribute computational resources across concurrent transaction execution
4. **Economic Efficiency**: Gas price prioritization ensures block space goes to the transactions with the highest economic value

We added comprehensive metrics instrumentation so you can monitor how the parallel pool is performing:

- Transaction throughput and queue depth monitoring
- Batch size and composition tracking
- Parallelizable transaction counts and ratios
- Execution success rates and error tracking

These metrics help you understand how things are working and optimize performance:

// Metrics for the pending pool
pendingParallelDiscardMeter   = metrics.NewRegisteredMeter("parallel/txpool/pending/discard", nil)
pendingParallelReplaceMeter   = metrics.NewRegisteredMeter("parallel/txpool/pending/replace", nil)
pendingParallelRateLimitMeter = metrics.NewRegisteredMeter("parallel/txpool/pending/ratelimit", nil) 
pendingParallelNofundsMeter   = metrics.NewRegisteredMeter("parallel/txpool/pending/nofunds", nil)   

// Metrics for the queued pool
queuedParallelDiscardMeter   = metrics.NewRegisteredMeter("parallel/txpool/queued/discard", nil)
queuedParallelReplaceMeter   = metrics.NewRegisteredMeter("parallel/txpool/queued/replace", nil)
queuedParallelNofundsMeter   = metrics.NewRegisteredMeter("parallel/txpool/queued/nofunds", nil)
queuedParallelRateLimitMeter = metrics.NewRegisteredMeter("parallel/txpool/queued/ratelimit", nil)

pendingParallelGauge = metrics.NewRegisteredGauge("parallel/txpool/pending", nil)
queuedParallelGauge  = metrics.NewRegisteredGauge("parallel/txpool/queued", nil)
localParallelGauge   = metrics.NewRegisteredGauge("parallel/txpool/local", nil)
slotsParallelGauge   = metrics.NewRegisteredGauge("parallel/txpool/slots", nil)

// New batch metrics
batchSizeGauge        = metrics.NewRegisteredGauge("parallel/txpool/batchsize", nil)
batchCountGauge       = metrics.NewRegisteredGauge("parallel/txpool/batchcount", nil)
parallelizableTxGauge = metrics.NewRegisteredGauge("parallel/txpool/parallelizable", nil)
```

## Future Research Directions

There are several areas we'd like to explore further:

1. **Smart Contract Interaction Analysis**: Better static analysis of contract interactions to predict transaction dependencies
2. **Adaptive Batch Optimization**: Dynamic adjustment of batch sizes based on system load and transaction characteristics
3. **Transaction Type Recognition**: Improved automatic classification of common transaction patterns
4. **Cross-pool Coordination**: Enhanced communication between transaction pool implementations to maximize global throughput
5. **Statistical Modeling**: Data-driven approaches to predict which transactions are likely to be parallelizable
6. **Client-side Integration**: Simplified APIs for wallets and applications to leverage parallel transaction processing
7. **EigenLayer-specific Optimizations**: Specialized mechanisms for AVS coordination and restaking-aware execution
